- Built on Python/TypeScript stack
- Integrate with Slack, Notion, Google Workspace

## Market Position
Market research industry is $80B+ globally. Competing against traditional firms (McKinsey, BCG) and newer AI tools (Dovetail, UserTesting).

**Competitors**: Dovetail (design research), Qualtrics (surveys), traditional consulting firms

**Advantage**: Speed and scalability. Can complete research in days vs weeks/months.

## Culture & Team
Team is heavily technical (60% engineering/data science). Founders both have PhDs and published AI research. Culture emphasizes shipping fast and customer obsession. LinkedIn shows frequent product launches. Remote-first with optional SF office. Glassdoor shows 4.2/5 with consistent praise for autonomy and mission, some concerns about pace.
