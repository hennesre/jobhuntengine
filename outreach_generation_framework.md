# Outreach Generation Framework

## Core Authenticity Principles

**Voice characteristics (based on example emails):**
- Conversational and direct
- Gets to the point in first 1-2 sentences
- Shows genuine curiosity about their work
- References specific things (podcasts, products, company decisions)
- Uses natural transitions ("So depending on...", "If you're up for it...")
- Ends with clear, easy ask
- No corporate jargon or buzzwords
- Imperfect is better than robotic

**What to avoid (LLM tells):**
- Overly formal openings ("I hope this message finds you well")
- Excessive enthusiasm or flattery
- Long, complex sentences
- Buzzword soup ("synergies", "passionate about", "excited to leverage")
- Generic statements that could apply to any company
- Over-explaining credentials
- Closing with "I look forward to the opportunity to discuss..."

**Structure principles:**
- Lead with why you're reaching out (specific role, specific interest)
- One relevant accomplishment or connection point
- Clear ask
- That's it. 4-5 sentences or 1-2 short paragraphs max.

Dear Hiring Team,

I'm writing to apply for the [Role Title] position at [Company]. [2-3 sentences about what specifically interests you about the company - their product approach, market, technical decisions, team, etc. Be specific and genuine.]

Over the past 5 years at Remesh, a B2B market research technology startup, I've launched three product lines from 0 to 1 that drove significant revenue growth. Remesh Flex, our second product line, now accounts for 16% of annual revenue. Remesh Recruit, which I built from scratch including our first-ever self-purchase flow, is adding $1.4M in ARR. Most recently, I led the team that built and launched Remy, an end-to-end AI agent built on a custom LLM orchestration layer. I've worked across the full stack of product development: strategy, execution, cross-functional leadership, and now hands-on technical work.

Over the past few months, I've added coding to my skillset using AI tools like Replit. I've pitched, built, and delivered two complete applications for external clients - a CRM system for a real estate firm and an automated sales prospecting tool that reduced manual workflow time by 75%. This evolution has given me much deeper technical fluency and a better understanding of what's possible with AI, which has made me more effective in conversations with engineering teams.

I'm looking for my next opportunity to build AI products at a company solving problems I care about. [1-2 sentences about why this specific company/role fits that - connect their mission/product to your interests or experience.]

I'd love to discuss how my experience building products from 0 to 1 could contribute to [Company]'s growth. Please let me know if you'd like to schedule a conversation.

Best regards,
Emmet Hennessy

## Generation Guidelines

**For each outreach request:**
1. Identify the type from the 11 above
2. Pull specific details from the role/company (never use placeholders like [Company])
3. Select 1-2 most relevant accomplishments from Emmet's background
4. Match the structure and length guidelines
5. Make it sound conversational and authentic (imperfect over robotic)
6. Read it out loud - if it sounds like marketing copy, rewrite it

**Red flags that output is too "LLM":**
- Uses phrases like "I am excited to leverage" or "I am passionate about"
- Every sentence is perfectly structured
- Cliche turns of phrase
- Use of em dashes or emojis 
- Too many adjectives
- Sounds like it could be sent to any company
- Over-explains or over-sells
- Generic praise ("innovative", "cutting-edge", "world-class")

**Good signals:**
- Gets to the point quickly
- References something specific about their work
- Natural, conversational flow
- Could only be sent to this specific person/company
- Shows genuine curiosity
- Brief and scannable
- Similar to other examples of Emmet's writing
