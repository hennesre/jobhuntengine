## Potential Concerns to Address Proactively

**If raised or relevant to bring up:**

### "Why are you leaving Remesh?"
**For startups**:"I've been there almost 5 years and built three product lines. The company's been through some changes [pending acquisition, growth slowing], and I'm ready for my next challenge. I want to be somewhere earlier in the growth curve where I can have even more impact on product direction."
**For big tech**:"I've been at Remesh for almost 5 years and have taken products from 0 to 1 multiple times. Now I want to work on products at real scale. I want to see how the best companies in the world approach product development and have resources to build things properly."


### "Why are you looking at [smaller company / bigger company]?"
**For startups**: "I want to build AI products at a company solving a problem I care about. I thrive in ambiguity and want to apply my 0-to-1 skills at a place that moves fast."

**For big tech**: "I want to work on products at real scale - millions of users, complex technical challenges, world-class teams. I've learned a ton at a startup, but I want to see how the best companies approach product development."

### "Tell me about your recent freelance work"
Use this as a strength, not a side project:
- "I pitched, built, and delivered two full-stack applications - a CRM for a real estate firm and an automated prospecting tool"
- "This added coding to my skillset and gave me much deeper technical fluency"
- "Now I can have more technical conversations with engineering and better understand tradeoffs"

### "What's your biggest weakness?"
Be authentic, show self-awareness:
- Could mention: moving too fast, impatience with slow processes, wanting to ship before perfect
- Frame as strength in right environment: "I move quickly and prefer action over endless analysis. That's a fit challenge in slower-moving orgs but a strength in environments that value shipping."

   - Or Remesh Recruit: First self-purchase flow, integrated with external panel, 6x YoY growth
   - Emphasize: defining scope, making tradeoffs, driving cross-functional execution

2. **"How do you prioritize when everything feels important?"**
   - Framework: impact vs effort, tie to business goals
   - Example: Remesh roadmap decisions balancing new features vs new product lines
   - Emphasize: data-driven, user-focused, clear communication of tradeoffs

3. **"Tell me about a time you had to convince stakeholders of a decision they disagreed with"**
   - Use Remesh Recruit variable pricing model or self-purchase flow decision

   - AI-specific: accuracy, hallucination rate, user trust
   - Business metrics: revenue, expansion, customer satisfaction

**Technical/AI:**

1. **"How do you approach build vs buy decisions for AI capabilities?"**
