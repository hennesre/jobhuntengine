# Interview Prep Framework

## Answer Bank Integration

**The Answer Bank is your library of polished, reusable interview answers.** Interview Prep identifies which questions you'll likely face and either:
1. Points you to existing answers in the Answer Bank
2. Identifies gaps where you should develop new answers

Over time, as your Answer Bank grows, interview prep becomes faster - you'll have polished answers ready for most common questions.

## Prep Process Overview

When Emmet says "Prep me for [Company] interview":

1. **Review company research** (if available) or conduct quick research
2. **Identify likely questions** based on role level, company stage, and challenges
3. **Check Answer Bank** - link to existing polished answers when available
4. **Identify gaps** - flag questions that need new answers developed
5. **Prepare questions to ask** based on company context and role
6. **Flag potential concerns** to address proactively

**Answer Bank Integration:**
- If polished answer exists in Answer Bank → reference it
- If no answer exists → suggest which experience to use, recommend developing full answer
- Over time, Answer Bank reduces prep work significantly

## Role-Specific Emphasis

- "How has the product evolved since you joined?"

## Potential Concerns to Address Proactively

**If raised or relevant to bring up:**

### "Why are you leaving Remesh?"
"I've been there almost 5 years and built three product lines. The company's been through some changes [acquisition], and I'm ready for my next challenge. I want to be somewhere earlier in the growth curve where I can have even more impact on product direction."

### "Why are you looking at [smaller company / bigger company]?"
**For startups**: "I want to build AI products at a company solving a problem I care about. I thrive in ambiguity and want to apply my 0-to-1 skills at a place that moves fast."

**For big tech**: "I want to work on products at real scale - millions of users, complex technical challenges, world-class teams. I've learned a ton at a startup, but I want to see how the best companies approach product development."

### "Tell me about your recent freelance work"
Use this as a strength, not a side project:
- "I pitched, built, and delivered two full-stack applications - a CRM for a real estate firm and an automated prospecting tool"
- "This added coding to my skillset and gave me much deeper technical fluency"
- "Now I can have more technical conversations with engineering and better understand tradeoffs"

### "What's your biggest weakness?"
Be authentic, show self-awareness:
- Could mention: moving too fast, impatience with slow processes, wanting to ship before perfect
- Frame as strength in right environment: "I move quickly and prefer action over endless analysis. That's a fit challenge in slower-moving orgs but a strength in environments that value shipping."

---

### Likely Questions

**Behavioral:**

1. **"Tell me about a time you built a product from 0 to 1"**
   - *Use Answer Bank: "Building Remesh Flex 0-to-1"* OR *Use Answer Bank: "Launching Remesh Recruit"*
   - Both cover: defining scope, making tradeoffs, driving cross-functional execution

2. **"How do you prioritize when everything feels important?"**
   - *Develop new answer* - Use Remesh roadmap decisions, balancing new features vs new product lines
   - Framework: impact vs effort, tie to business goals, data-driven

3. **"Tell me about a time you had to convince stakeholders of a decision they disagreed with"**
   - *Develop new answer* - Use Remesh Recruit variable pricing model or self-purchase flow decision
   - Emphasize: data to support POV, understanding their concerns, finding alignment

**Product Sense:**

1. **"How would you expand Fictive's product into new verticals?"**
   - Clarify: current verticals, customer feedback, resource constraints
   - Approach: identify adjacent use cases, assess market size, pilot with design partners
   - Reference: similar expansion at Remesh (research → global with multi-language)

2. **"How do you measure success for an AI product?"**
   - User metrics: adoption, retention, task completion
   - AI-specific: accuracy, hallucination rate, user trust
   - Business metrics: revenue, expansion, customer satisfaction

**Technical/AI:**

1. **"How do you approach build vs buy decisions for AI capabilities?"**
   - Framework: differentiation vs commodity, team expertise, time to market
   - Example: Remesh built custom orchestration layer for Remy because it was core differentiator
   - Freelance: Used existing LLMs via API because focus was workflow, not model

2. **"What's your experience working with ML engineers?"**
   - Remesh Remy team: collaborated on LLM orchestration architecture
   - Emphasize: can have technical conversations, understand constraints, prioritize together

**Company-Specific:**

1. **"Why Fictive?"**
   "I'm fascinated by how you're unbundling traditional research with AI. At Remesh, I built similar AI research tools and saw the market pull firsthand - enterprises are hungry for faster insights. Your approach with custom fine-tuning and multi-modal analysis is the right technical bet. Plus, you're at the stage where I can have real impact on product direction."

2. **"What do you know about our product?"**
   - Core product: AI research assistant for qualitative analysis
   - Differentiation: custom LLM fine-tuning, multi-modal (not just text)
   - Recent launch: real-time research capability
   - Competitor landscape: Dovetail (design research), Qualtrics (surveys), traditional consulting
