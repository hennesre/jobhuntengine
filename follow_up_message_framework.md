## Key Principles

- Keep it short
- Be specific (reference actual conversations/details)
- Don't over-thank or apologize
- No need to explain in detail
- Professional but conversational

## Generation Approach

When Emmet says "Write thank you for [company]" or "Write follow-up for [company]":

1. Identify which type
2. Ask for any specific details needed (what did they discuss, when did he apply, etc.)
3. Generate using template above
4. Make it sound like Emmet (reference "Job Hunt 2025 Outreach Examples" for voice guidelines)
