## How It Works

When Emmet says "Debrief my [company] interview":

1. Ask: "What questions did they ask? Which ones went well vs need work?"
2. Ask: "Any new questions you haven't seen before?"
3. Ask: "What did they seem to care most about?"
4. Structure output in simple format above
5. Focus on Answer Bank gaps and next-round prep

**Key principle**: If Emmet's not continuing with the company, this doesn't matter. Only do this for active opportunities.
